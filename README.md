This console boilerplate is very much like rails and its boot process.


* Clone the repo.
* Add any gems to the Gemfile
* Bundle install

```
$ bundle install --path lib
```

* Add your application files to the app folder.  Nested folders are also supported under app.
* Run the application with

```
$ ruby boot.rb
```
